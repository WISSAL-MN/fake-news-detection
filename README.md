## Fake News Detection

In this project, I have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1.Python 3


1.1 This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.
    
1.2 Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic.
